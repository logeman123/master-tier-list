- each person should have their own page

- combined table

Ok i'm looking to create a group synthesized data table that aggregates a friend groups tier lists together. We're looking to make a 'master tier list' that will look over every single thing in life and rank them (mostly as a joke)

Ok one big thing that we want is that there should be 1 aggregated tier list, and then each user should have access to their own tier list. Additionally if possible every time someone adds a new item to their own tier list it should put it into an 'unsorted' section in everybody elses tier list. By the way it should go S, A, B,C,D,F
